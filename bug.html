I'm encountering an unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS where a seemingly correctly implemented class isn't being applied.  I've checked the Tailwind configuration, the class name, and the HTML structure, but the style remains absent. I've also ensured that the Tailwind directives are correctly placed in my CSS file and that the CSS file is being correctly imported or linked to my HTML file. The relevant HTML section looks like this:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
  This div should have a blue background.
</div>
```

The Tailwind configuration and CSS are standard and seem properly set up.

I've tried restarting my development server, but the problem persists.
