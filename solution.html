The issue might stem from several uncommon sources:

1. **Incorrect PurgeCSS Configuration (if used):** If you use PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS, ensure that the `bg-blue-500` and `p-4` classes are included in your PurgeCSS configuration.  If not, PurgeCSS might have removed the relevant CSS rules.

2. **CSS Specificity Conflicts:** Another possibility is a conflicting CSS rule with higher specificity that overrides the Tailwind classes. Check for any global styles or stylesheets that might be affecting the element's background and padding.

3. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check for any typos in the class name.  Even a small mistake can prevent the class from being applied. Carefully compare the class name in your HTML against the Tailwind CSS documentation.

4. **Incorrect Import/Path:** Confirm that your Tailwind CSS styles are correctly imported or linked into the HTML file. Verify that the path to the CSS file is accurate and that the file is accessible.

5. **Caching Issues:** Sometimes, browsers can cache outdated CSS files. Try clearing your browser's cache or using a different browser to see if the problem persists.  Also, ensure that your development server automatically reloads the updated CSS when changes are made.

6. **Build Process Problems (for frameworks):** If you're using a framework like Next.js, Nuxt.js, or others,  double-check your build configuration. Issues in the build process can sometimes result in incorrect CSS generation or inclusion.

**Example Solution (assuming PurgeCSS is the problem):**

Modify your PurgeCSS configuration to include the relevant classes:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.html'], // Adjust to match your file structure
  safelist: ['bg-blue-500', 'p-4']
};
```

**Revised HTML (Illustrative):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Tailwind Example</title>
  <link href="path/to/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This div should have a blue background and padding.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
Remember to replace `path/to/output.css` with the actual path to your compiled Tailwind CSS file.
