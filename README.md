# Tailwind CSS Class Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS class fails to apply despite seemingly correct implementation and configuration.  The issue persists even after restarting the development server.

## Problem

A simple `div` element with the class `bg-blue-500` (for a blue background) and `p-4` (padding) fails to render the expected styles.  The Tailwind configuration, CSS import, and HTML structure appear to be correct, yet the styles are not applied.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
4. Start the development server (instructions may vary depending on your project setup).

## Reproduce

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  The `div` element should have a blue background and padding, but it will not.

## Solution

The solution file (`solution.html`) demonstrates a possible fix or workaround. Note that the actual solution may depend on the specific details of your project configuration.
